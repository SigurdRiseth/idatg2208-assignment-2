# Data Directory

This directory is intended to store datasets used in the machine learning exercises.

## Structure:
- Raw data files (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Preprocessed data files from Exercise-1
- Train/test splits
- Feature engineered datasets

## Note:
Add your dataset files here. Make sure to update .gitignore if you have large files that shouldn't be committed to version control.
